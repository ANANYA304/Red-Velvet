Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter three 9-inch cake rounds. Dust with flour and tap out the excess.
Mix together flour, sugar, cornstarch, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder and salt until combined.
Add eggs, buttermilk, warm water, oil, vanilla extract, vinegar and red food colouring (optional). Beat until smooth. This may take a couple of minutes.
Divide the batter among the three prepaired pans.
Bake for 30-35 minutes until the cake meets the toothpick test (stick a toothpick in and it comes out clean).
Cool on wire rack for 15 minutes and then turn out the cakes onto the racks.
Your yummy 'n' wonderfull Red Velvet cake is ready to serve. ENJOY!
